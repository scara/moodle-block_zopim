Zopim Live Chat widget
======================
This is a block plug-in for Moodle.  

Description
-----------
It allows you to add the Zopim functionalities to your Moodle instance.  
Log into the Zopim's dashboard with your account, go through the wizard
and you'll get your widget code containing your unique identifier, required
to setup the global setting of this block.  

The block will show the users the availability of the service (offline, online):
when the user clicks on the availability icon, the livechat window
at the bottom right of the screen will be opened if hidden, hidden otherwise. 

User's email, full name and language preference will be used to fill the fields
in the livechat window, when logged-in in Moodle.
